### Breaking Changes

None. This release maintains full API compatibility with existing Sonic API.

### Migration

#### From Standard Library
```go
// Before
import "encoding/json"
data, err := json.Marshal(obj)

// After
import "github.com/bytedance/sonic"
data, err := sonic.Marshal(obj)
```

#### From Other JSON Libraries
- Replace import statements
- Update function calls
- Handle any behavioral differences
- Test for performance improvements

### Security

#### Vulnerability Scanning

- ✅ Code generation validation
- ✅ Runtime safety checks

### Known Issues

#### Limitations
- Some complex generic types may not benefit from JIT optimization
- JIT compilation has initial overhead (mitigated by caching)
- Memory usage may be higher initially (reduced by pooling)

#### Platform-Specific Issues
- Some embedded systems may need additional permissions
- Certain container environments may restrict JIT execution

### Future Plans

#### Short Term (Next 3 months)
- Enhanced JIT optimizations for edge cases
- Performance improvements for complex nested structures
- Additional SIMD optimizations
- Better integration monitoring

#### Medium Term (3-6 months)
- Windows ARM64 native support
- iOS ARM64 support
- WebAssembly ARM64 support
- Advanced JIT optimizations

#### Long Term (6+ months)
- Machine learning-based optimization
- Hardware-specific optimizations
- Cloud-native deployment patterns
- Ecosystem integration
